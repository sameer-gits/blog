### Prerequisites:

1. Go - [Download here](https://go.dev)
2. Text Editor - I use Vim BTW, you can use VS Code or any editor

### Let's get started!

Open your terminal in any folder and type

```
mkdir your_blog_name
```
then go inside your folder
```
cd your_blog_name
```
open it using your editor, for vim
```
vim .
```
for VS Code
```
code .
```
Great! Now let create our first file main.go

Press <kbd>%</kbd> and write main.go in Vim. for VS Code <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd>
Now type this
<pre><code class="language-go">Package main
func main() {
}
</code></pre>
